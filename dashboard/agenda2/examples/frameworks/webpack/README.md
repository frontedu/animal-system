# Custom build demo

This very basic demo shows how to use webpack to do a custom build from our sources.

*NOTE:* Unfortunately this demo does not work with the trial version, since it does not include sources. To be able to
make a custom build, you need the full version of Bryntum Calendar.

## Babel loader

We use Babel loader to add support for newest JavaScript features.
Visit this page to get more info for installing and configuring loader.

## Building

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to build it

After build, surf to `examples/frameworks/webpack/index.html` to see it in action.
