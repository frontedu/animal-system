# What's new in Grid v4.0.6

## Grid#deselectAll behavior change

In previous versions, it was not possible to clear selections completely if the view was filtered. As of 4.0.6, the
default behavior of `deselectAll()` is to clear all selections. If you wish to keep the old behavior of keeping
selections of filtered out rows, pass `true` as the first and only param

Existing fixes are planned to be removed in version 5.0.

**Old code:**

```javascript
grid.deselectAll(); // Previously deselected only rows part of the current filtered row set 
```

**New code:**

```javascript
grid.deselectAll(true); // Pass true to clear selections in current rowset but keep earlier selections
```
