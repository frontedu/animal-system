# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.0.3

## New Vue wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents`

This option was introduced to allow relaying of store events to the Grid instance. It defaults to `false` (no events
relayed) which changes the default behavior so if your application relies on relayed events, configure it as `true`.

Example:
```html
<bryntum-grid
    :relayStoreEvents="true"
>
```

The config option applies to both Vue 2 and Vue 3.
