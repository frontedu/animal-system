# Displaying data in a Grid

Bryntum Grid uses a `Store` to hold and manage data in JSON format. The store in turn uses a `Model` for each row
(called record) it holds. The `Model` defines which fields the data contains. This guide is meant to give an overview of
how you work with stores and models.

## Creating a Grid with data

This sections describes the different options you have out of the box to create a grid with inline data or by loading
remote data using Ajax.

### Using inline data

If you have inline data, you can supply it directly when creating a grid:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    columns : [/*...*/],
    data : [
        { id : 1, name : 'Batman' },
        { id : 2, name : 'Wolverine' },
        /*...*/
    ] 
});
```

This will create a store holding the data. The store can be accessed through the store property:

```javascript
grid.store.sort('name');
```

Another options if you need to configure the store is to supply a store config object (for info on available configs,
see API docs):

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    store : {
        sorters : [
            { field : 'name' }      
        ],
        data : [
            { id : 1, name : 'Batman' },
            /*...*/
        ] 
    }
});
```

A third option is to supply an already existing `Store` instance:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
   someConfig : "...",
   data : [
       { id : 1, name : 'Batman' },
       /*...*/
   ]  
});

const grid = new Grid({
    store
});
```

Inline data is expected to be an array of JavaScript objects. If no model/fields are defined for the store (more info
below) the properties of the first entry in the array are used as fields (`id` and `name` in the examples above).

### Using remote data

The base Store class only handles inline data. If you want to load remote data, use an `AjaxStore` in its place. As with
inline data you have different options on how to set it up. Either supply a store config containing a `readUrl`:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    store : {
        readUrl : 'backend/load.php', // When Grid finds readUrl in the store config it will create an AjaxStore
        autoLoad : true // Load upon creation
    }
});
```

Or create the store prior to creating the grid:

```javascript
const store = new AjaxStore({
   readUrl : 'backend/load.aspx'
});

const grid = new Grid({
    store
});

store.load();
```

The data returned from the backend is expected to have the following format:

```json
{
    "success" : true,
    "data" : [  
        { "id" : 1, "name" : "Batman" },
        { "..." : "..." }
    ]
}
```

If `AjaxStore does not suite your needs you can of course load data any custom way you want and then plug it into an 
inline store:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    columns : [/*...*/]
});

// Using native fetch to load data
const response = await fetch('backend/load.php');
const data = await response.json();

// Maybe do some custom processing before plugging into grids store
data.forEach((row, index) => {
    row.index = index;
    row.someValue = Math.random();
    /*...*/
});

// Plug it in as inline data
grid.store.data = data;
```

## Model, field and record

As mentioned above, a store holds instances of a Model. Each instance is called a record (a row in the Grid). The Model,
among other things, specifies which fields the data contains.

### Autogenerated Model

If you do not specify any model, one will be created for you. The properties of the first record in your data will be
turned into fields:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    data : [
        { name : 'Wolverine', powers : 'Regeneration' },
        { name : 'Deadpool', powers : 'Yes I have, great powers' }   
    ]
});
```

The code above will create a store with two records, based on a generated Model containing the two fields `name` and
`powers`.

### Custom Model

If you need more control over the fields a model contains, you have two options. If you do not need to reuse the Model
you can simply specify the fields when creating the store:

```javascript
const store = new Store({
    fields : ['name', 'powers', 'affiliation'],
    data : [
        { name : 'Wolverine', powers : 'Regeneration' },
        /*...*/
    ]
});
```

You can also create a subclass of `Model` and define the fields you need on it:

```javascript
class SuperHero extends Model {
    static get fields() {
        return ['name', 'powers', 'affiliation' ];
    }
}

const store = new Store({
    modelClass : SuperHero,
    data : [/*...*/]
}); 
```

See the API docs for [Model](#Core/data/Model) for more information on defining and mapping fields.

### Models are reactive!

Fields are turned into setters on the records, which makes them reactive. For example doing this...

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    data : [
        { name : 'Wolverine', powers : 'Regeneration' },
        { name : 'Deadpool', powers : 'Yes I have, great powers' }   
    ]
});

grid.store.first.name = 'Logan'; 
```

...will update the grid on the fly to display 'Logan' instead of 'Wolverine'.
