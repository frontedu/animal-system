# Upgrade guide for Calendar v5.0.3

## Validating CrudManager responses by default
The `validateResponse` flag on CrudManager has been changed to default to `true`. When enabled, it validates CrudManager
responses from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful during the 
development phase, but can be turned off in production:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
   crudManager : {
       // Turn response validation off
       validateResponse : false,
       ...
   } 
});
```

## New Vue wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents`

This option was introduced to allow relaying of store events to the Calendar instance. It defaults to `false` (no events
relayed) which changes the default behavior so if your application relies on relayed events, configure it as `true`.

Example:
```html
<bryntum-calendar
    :relayStoreEvents="true"
>
```

The config option applies to both Vue 2 and Vue 3.
