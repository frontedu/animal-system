# Upgrade guide for Calendar v4.2.4

## Gap between events

`DayView` has a new config named `eventSpacing` which is used to reduce the height of all events in day and week views
to leave a small gap between them. This new appearance is used by default (`eventSpacing` defaults to `1`).

In previous versions this gap was faked using a gray bottom border on the events. If you prefer the old appearance, you 
can configure `eventSpacing: 0` and apply a bottom border using CSS:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    modes : {
        day : {
            // Remove the gap between events
            eventSpacing : 0
        }
    }
});
```

```css
/* Add bottom border to events in day & week views */
.b-dayview-day-container .b-cal-event {
    border-bottom    : 1px solid #ddd;
}
```
