# What's new in Calendar v5.0.3

## ProjectModel wrapper for Angular, React & Vue

Calendar ships with a new `ProjectModel` wrapper that can be used to share data between multiple Bryntum components in
the same app by pointing them all to the same project instance. Either you use it to load data from the backend using
the built-in `CrudManager` or you bind your locally available data to it. 

Integration details can be found in guides for
[Angular](#Calendar/guides/integration/angular/data-binding.md#binding-existing-data-to-the-project),
[React](#Calendar/guides/integration/react/data-binding.md#binding-existing-data-to-the-project) and
[Vue](#Calendar/guides/integration/vue/data-binding.md#binding-existing-data-to-the-project).
