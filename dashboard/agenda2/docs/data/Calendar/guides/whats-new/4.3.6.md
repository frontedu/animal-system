## `coreHours` config for `DayView` and `WeekView` 

`DayView` and `WeekView` have a new config, `coreHours` which specifies the core working hours to show. Hours outside
that range are represented by a translucent mask covering the time axis for those hours. If the `overlayDay` property
is set in the config, the mask extends to overlay the day part of the view:

**Sample config:**

```js
  coreHours : {
      start      : 9,
      end        : 17,
      overlayDay : true
  }
```
