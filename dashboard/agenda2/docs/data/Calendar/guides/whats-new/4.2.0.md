# What's new in Calendar v4.2.0

## Shifting day start

Calendar has a new `dayStartShift` config for the day/week views that allow day columns to start their 24-hour period at 
a specified time other than midnight. Useful for example for shift work, when a work day spans midnight. With this 
config, the work shift can be visualized as a single day instead of two days. Check it out in the new 
[shifted](../examples/shifted) demo and/or try it out below:

<div class="external-example" data-file="Calendar/guides/whats-new/4.2.0/daystartshift.js"></div>

Extract from the demo above, showing how to configure day and week views:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    modes : {
        // The "midnight shift" (24-hours starts at 6PM instead of 12AM):
        day : {
            dayStartShift : 18
        },
        week : {
            dayStartShift : 18
        }
    }
});
```

NOTE: This differs from `dayStartTime` which only controls the first time to render.
