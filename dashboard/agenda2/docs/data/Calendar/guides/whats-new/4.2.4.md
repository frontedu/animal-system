# What's new in Calendar v4.2.4

## Improvements when using Scheduler as a Calendar mode

This release introduces two new configs on Scheduler specifically added for when using it as a mode in Calendar (as can 
be seen in the `calendar-scheduler` demo):

* [range](#Scheduler/view/SchedulerBase#config-range) - That lets you easily control how much time the time axis 
  spans. It accepts a unit name such as `month`, `week` or `day`.
* [stepUnit](#Scheduler/view/SchedulerBase#config-stepUnit) - Also accepts a unit name, which is used to determine how
  large steps in time to take when clicking the previous and next buttons on the Calendar's toolbar.

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    modes : {
        timeline : {
            type : 'scheduler',

            // Show one month at the time 
            range : 'month',

            // Step a single day when clicking previous / next
            stepUnit : 'day'
        }
    }
});
```
