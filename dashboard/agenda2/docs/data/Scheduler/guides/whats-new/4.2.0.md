# What's new in Scheduler v4.2.0

## Infinite time axis scroll

This release adds a long awaited feature for Scheduler (and Scheduler Pro) - infinite scroll along the time axis. To 
enable it, configure your scheduler with `infiniteScroll : true`. When a user scrolls to near the start or end of the 
time axis, it will be seamlessly extended. 

Try it out in the new [infinite-scroll demo](../examples/infinite-scroll) or right here:

<div class="external-example" data-file="Scheduler/guides/whats-new/4.2.0/infinitescroll.js"></div>

## Data driven event resizing

Previously resizing an event in Scheduler was an operation that acted on the DOM element level, translating the width 
change to a date/time change on the fly.

With this release, resizing instead directly affects the underlying data, using the normal rendering paths to update the 
DOM element. This change has two big upsides:

* It works in combination with the new infinite scroll feature, allowing you to resize events towards infinity âˆž
* Since it uses the normal rendering paths, what you see during resize is much closer to what you will get when you 
  release the mouse - fewer surprises from layout calculations coming into play

On a related note, `EventResize` can now be configured to allow resizing an event to be zero duration, using the
 [allowResizeToZero](#Scheduler/feature/EventResize#config-allowResizeToZero) config.

## Easier to create dependencies using drag and drop

Dependencies can now be created by dropping anywhere on the event bar element, whereas in previous versions you had to 
hit a specific side circle element to define it. This new behaviour is controlled using the 
[allowDropOnEventBar](#Scheduler/feature/mixin/DependencyCreation#config-allowDropOnEventBar) config of the Dependencies 
feature. It is enabled by default, try it here:

<div class="external-example" data-file="Scheduler/guides/whats-new/4.2.0/dependencies.js"></div>
