# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v5.0.4

## EventCopyPaste event deprecations

The events triggered by the `EventCopyPaste` feature (`beforeCopy`, `beforePaste`) now passes both `eventRecords` and
`assignmentsRecords`. The old `records` param was because of this deprecated and will be removed in 6.0. Please adjust
your code accordingly to avoid surprises down the road.

**Old code**
```javascript
scheduler.on({
    beforeCopy({ records }) {
        console.log(records.map(r => r.name).join(', '));
    }
})
```

**New code**
```javascript
scheduler.on({
    beforeCopy({ eventRecords }) {
        console.log(eventRecords.map(r => r.name).join(', '));
    }
})
```
