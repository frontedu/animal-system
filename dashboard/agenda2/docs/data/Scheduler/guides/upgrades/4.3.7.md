# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v4.3.7

## PdfExport feature

`beforeExport` Scheduler event has been renamed to [beforePdfExport](#Grid/feature/export/PdfExport#event-beforePdfExport)
and `export` event has been renamed to [pdfExport](#Grid/feature/export/PdfExport#event-pdfExport) respectively.
Please modify your code to match the new names.

**Old code:**

```javascript
scheduler.on({
    beforeExport({ config }) { /*...*/ },

    export({ config }) { /*...*/ }
})
```

**New code:**

```javascript
scheduler.on({
    beforePdfExport({ config }) {
        const { orientation } = config;
        /*...*/
    },

    pdfExport({ config }) {
        const { orientation } = config;
        /*...*/
    }
});
```

Also the events signature had deprecated properties copied from `config` section
which have been removed in this release.
