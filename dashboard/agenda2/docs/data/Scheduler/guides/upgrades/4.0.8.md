# What's new in Scheduler v4.0.8

## Added short responses support to Crud Manager

Crud Manager default behaviour has been changed to allow short `sync` responses that include only server-side
changes.
Previously it was mandatory to mention all updated and removed records in the response to confirm the
changes are applied.
With this release the Crud Manager automatically confirms changes of all updated/removed records mentioned in
the corresponding `sync` request.
If your code relies on the old behavior please use [supportShortSyncResponse](#Scheduler/data/CrudManager#config-supportShortSyncResponse)
to enable it back.
To revert to the old behavior please set 
[supportShortSyncResponse](#Scheduler/data/CrudManager#config-supportShortSyncResponse) config to `false`:

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    /*...*/
    crudManager : {
        // disable simlified responses support
        supportShortSyncResponse : false,
        /*...*/
    }
});
```
