# What's new in Scheduler v3.1.6

## Angular, React and Vue `schedulerEngine` has been renamed to `schedulerInstance`

To avoid confusing the calculating engine with the instance of Bryntum Scheduler, `schedulerEngine` has been renamed
to `schedulerInstance`. The change is backwards compatible hence applications using `schedulerEngine` will still work,
but with deprecation warning in the console.

Change all occurrences of `schedulerEngine` to `schedulerInstance` in your Angular, React or Vue application to get rid
of the warning and to make the application consistent with Bryntum Scheduler wrapper naming.
