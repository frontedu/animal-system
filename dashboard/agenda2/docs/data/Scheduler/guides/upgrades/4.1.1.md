# What's new in Scheduler v4.1.1

Be sure to also check out the news in [Grid](#Grid/guides/upgrades/4.1.1.md).

## Scheduler event drag events

The `context` param of the Scheduler `beforeEventDrag`, `eventDragStart`, `eventDrag`, `eventDragAbort`
events was deprecated and will be removed in 5.0. `eventRecords` and `assignmentRecords` are available
on the top level of the arguments.

## Scheduler time axis header events

* The events fired by Scheduler.column.TimeAxisColumn (`timeaxisheaderclick`, `timeaxisheadercontextmenu`,
  `timeaxisheaderdblclick`) were deprecated and should instead be listened to on the owning Scheduler / Gantt component.

```javascript
scheduler.on({
  timeAxisHeaderClick : event => { /*...*/ }
})
```

## Wrapper dependencies

In order to support installing trial package alias for wrappers they now require adding `@bryntum/scheduler`
dependency to application's **package.json** file.

**Example for licensed version for Angular framework:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bryntum/scheduler": "4.1.1",
    "@bryntum/scheduler-angular": "4.1.1"
  }
}
```

**Example for trial version for Angular framework:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bryntum/scheduler": "npm:@bryntum/scheduler-trial@4.1.1",
    "@bryntum/scheduler-angular": "4.1.1"
  }
}
```
